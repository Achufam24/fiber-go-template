# /app

This folder contains our business logic, and that's it.

This directory doesn't care about what database driver you are using or which caching solution your using, or any third-party apps.

Its only job is to provide the business-related details, including structuring the models, authorizing the clients, storing them in the database, or sending it to the clients.
